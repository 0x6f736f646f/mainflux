# Shifting from Mainflux version 0.11.0 to 0.14.0

In today's digital age, the term "client" can refer to a wide range of entities, including human users, devices, and software applications. Managing these clients can be a complex and challenging task, especially in large-scale systems. In this document, we will explore the concept of clients in detail and discuss how they are managed in a microservices-based architecture. Specifically, we will take a deep dive into the Clients service, a central component of our platform, and examine how it unites the Mainflux Things and Users services to provide a single, cohesive solution for managing clients. We will also explore the Clients service's core features, including client authentication, access control policies, and traceability, to gain a comprehensive understanding of how it fits into the broader system architecture. By the end of this post, you will have a solid grasp of the Clients service's functionality and how it enables efficient and secure client management.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Is The Objective

1. Improved security: One of the key benefits of moving to a fine-grained access control system is that it allows for more granular control over who can access what information or systems. This can help to improve overall security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
2. Increased flexibility: A fine-grained access control system can be more flexible than a keto rules engine, allowing for more nuanced control over access rights. This can help to better accommodate the needs of different users or services, and can make it easier to adapt to changing business needs.
3. Simplified management: Depending on the specific implementation, a fine-grained access control system may be easier to manage than a keto rules engine. This could be due to factors such as a more intuitive user interface, more streamlined processes, or easier integration with other systems.
